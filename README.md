MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THIS PROJECT WAS FIGURING OUT HOW TO
GET THE LABELS IN PAIRS SIDE BY SIDE. TOOK A LOT OF FIXING
AND TESTING BUT I EVENTUALLY GOT IT. I ALSO HAD AN ISSUE WITH 
MAKING SURE MY WEBSITE STILL LOOKED PRESENTABLE WHEN MESSING WITH 
DESKTOP RESOLUTION. MOBILE/TABLET COMPATABILITY IS SOMETHING THAT I WILL BE WORKING ON NEXT ALONG WITH JUST GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS AS I GET BETTER!
